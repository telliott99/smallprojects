Article II
Section I
"Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives .. "

Amendment XII
"The Electors shall meet in their respective states, and vote by ballot for President and Vice-President, one of whom, at least, shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves; they shall name in their ballots the person voted for as President, and in distinct ballots the person voted for as Vice-President .. "

Analysis:
Article V prohibits any modification of the rules for choosing the Senators (2 from each state) which would deprive a state of equal suffrage in the Senate.

There is argument about whether a two-step process would work:  i.e. first amend to change article V, then amend to change Article I.

Article II sets out the rules for the Electoral College.  It has *already* been amended (Amendment XII).

There seems no reason why the Electoral College could not be abolished.
