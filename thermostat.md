### Setting the Trane Thermostat

Our new thermostats (8-1-2017) are 

* Trane XL824 Smart Control

They are not connected to WiFi and the internet, but they *could* be.  It isn't clear from the manual whether you could just hook them up to the LAN and access them locally, without subscribing to their special **Nexia Home Intelligence** service.

This is the home screen from the manual

Before I did anything, I needed to change the screen brightness to 100% so I could actually see it. Press

* Menu > Settings

<img src="menu.png" style="width: 400px;"/>

* Display

<img src="settings.png" style="width: 400px;"/>

and follow the on-screen prompt.

If you want to turn the unit off quickly, press System Mode on the home screen (next to Menu) and toggle the button.  The system in the figure below is set to **Auto** (heat or cool, whatever is necessary).

If the screen is locked, the super-duper secret unlocking method is to press **Menu** on the home screen for 5 seconds.  Screen lock set and unset is done from the menu screen.

#### Overview

There are two modes for controlling the unit:  a basic one and something more advanced.  The latter is called **Scheduling**, and the basic mode is called **1-Touch**.

On the main screen is displayed the actual indoor temperature, in large digits on the left.  Below it is  **Cooling** or **System Idle** or **System Off** etc.

Next below that (just above **Menu**) is a description of which one of these modes is in use, e.g. **Scheduling disabled** or **Following Schedule X**.

Below that are four buttons that bring up additional screens:  **Menu**, **System Mode**, **Fan Mode**, and **Air Cleaner**.  

To change whether scheduling is enabled, do

*  Menu > Settings 

<img src="settings.png" style="width: 400px;"/>

and toggle the Schedules button.

Go **Back** to **Menu**.  

In the manual, the **Menu** screen also has a button titled **Schedules**.  On our actual controls, if scheduling is off and we're in 1-Touch mode, this button says **1-Touch Presets**...

If scheduling is enabled and the button says **Schedules**, then pressing it leads to a screen for laying out custom schedules.  You should look at the manual for instructions on how to do that.  It's pretty straightforward.

1-Touch Presets, which is a version of the Temperature Control Panel, can also be reached from the home screen by pressing in the Indoor Temperature area on the left. Press the number "76" in this example.

The display shown below for Temperature Control Panel is the one seen when in **1-Touch** mode (the one for when scheduling is enabled is different).

Toggle "Away" etc. to select which temperature setting you want to change.  The top temperature setting is for cooling and the bottom for heating.  The arrows on the right change the values.  The wavy blue icon indicates cooling (i.e. the top value is toggled).

Back on the home screen, in the upper right-hand corner is an icon that says **Away** 

<img src="home.png" style="width: 400px;"/>

I had trouble understanding this at first, because **Away** is always visible on the home screen, but it is much brighter when "Away" mode is actually selected.

Toggling this button to **Away** on the home screen *overrides* scheduling.

So rather than turn scheduling off, we might have just activated **Away** by hitting this button, and if the temperature had been set lower than ambient (it is set to 85 by default), then the unit would cool as we want.

If scheduling is active, then the temperature control screen shows what is on the far left in the next figure, rather than Away, etc.

Thus, another way to maintain the current settings indefinitely, with scheduling active, would be to select **Hold Perm**.  However, the default is to only **Hold Until** the next scheduled period begins.

#### Optimization

One potential problem is a feature called Smart Optimization, on the Menu screen

This shuts down the system for 90 minutes after it has been up for 18 hours.  I turned it off.  I guess the idea is that it would monitor the rate at which the temperature rises with the unit off.
