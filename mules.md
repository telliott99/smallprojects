### Moscow mules

We're late to the party, but we started enjoying Moscow mules recently.

For a bit of history, see [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_mule).  

There seems to be a dispute about whether the drink originated in New York or in Hollywood, in the early 1940's.  What is surprising is that vodka was not yet popular in America, and this was an attempt to improve the situation.

A basic mule contains vodka and ginger beer, with a bit of lime.

I use [Rose's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose%27s_lime_juice) lime juice.  There is more to say about Ginger beer, see below.

#### Copper mugs

According to tradition, a mule is served in a copper cup.  Here is part of the [legend](https://moscowcopper.com/pages/our-story?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIiLf835vF1QIVSUsNCh3iVQEgEAAYASAAEgKH_PD_BwE)

<p style="color:blue">
"In 1941, Sophie Berezinski was a woman on a mission. She had immigrated to the United States from Russia and was carrying a heavy burden: 2,000 solid copper mugs. Sophie’s father owned and operated a copper factory in Russia known as the Moscow Copper Co. Back in Russia, Sophie had created the design for the original copper mug that is now so famously linked to the Moscow Mule cocktail. Her father ran the presses that stamped out  the mugs.

<p style="color:blue">
The one tool both Sophie and her father lacked was the slick skills of a salesman. Neither Sophie nor her father were able to sell the mugs in Russia, so the decision was made that Sophie and the mugs would journey to America. After all, it was well known that America was the land of opportunity."

#### Copper and acid

Most mugs have a lining so that the copper doesn't contact the drink.  It's well known that acidic foods cooked in copper can contain high levels of the metal and make you sick (actually it's going to be Cu<sup>2+</sup>).  

Copper is also a micronutrient.  The [RDA for copper](http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/minerals/copper) (adults) is 900 &mu;g per day, and the "safe" level for drinking water is 2 mg (WHO) or 1.3 mg (EPA) per liter.  

[OTOH, should one of us prove to have an undiagnosed genetic disorder affecting copper storage, the safe level might be much less.]

One study cited on the page above had subjects ingest 8 mg per day for 147 days without significant damage (including to the liver).  However, they did accumulate copper, so this is probably too much for the long term.

The question is what happens at pH 3 or so during 15 min at a temperature of 0&deg; C.

We could do some [chemistry](http://www.chemguide.co.uk/inorganic/transition/copper.html), but since mg levels are reasonably safe, I thought we would just weigh the mugs.

#### Experiment

We obtained 4 mugs from ___.  They are advertised as pure copper and have no obvious lining (though they might have a coating we don't detect---they don't seem to be oxidizing).

The plan is to see if **the weight changes** during extended use.  

Luckily I still have my Sartorius balance.  (Not the nicest one, but the readout for the one I do have goes to 1 mg).

The problem is how to tell the 4 mugs apart.  I weighed each one:

    2017-Aug-6
    #1 276.209
    #2 280.266
    #3 285.094 (h = mark on handle)
    #4 277.126 (f = slightly damaged foot)

We used `f` and `h` and one of the others (not sure which) to make a Mule on 8-6.

I washed and dried them afterward (obviously, this is important to get an accurate weight).  We're not worrying about oils from fingers, etc.  That would only matter if we had microgram accuracy.

The next day (8-7-2017), I weighed the two "marked" ones again:

    2017-Aug-7
    285.097 h
    280.268 f

Two conclusions:  the damaged foot isn't obvious enough because the one I thought was `f` today is clearly `#2` from yesterday.  

Second, we're probably not losing 10 mg per day.  So we can safely let the experiment run for a while.

#### (Almost) one week later

I was unable convince the gang to keep accurate records of which cups had how many mules made, but I have one cup that was unused (u), the others had roughly one mule per day.  

I matched them up with the previous numbering system by the gram weights:

    2017-Aug-12
    #1 276.226 (u)
    #2 280.280
    #3 285.109 (h)
    #4 277.191

Compared to the initial values

    2017-Aug-6
    #1 276.209
    #2 280.266
    #3 285.094 (h)
    #4 277.126

we see a problem:  we're *gaining* weight.

The &Delta;s

    #1 + 0.015 (u)
    #2 + 0.014
    #3 + 0.015 (h)
    #4 + 0.065

I dry them gently for 15 min on low in the warming oven, then cool for 30 min at RT.

    2017-Aug-12 2nd weighing
    #1 276.213 (u)
    #2 280.273
    #3 285.102 (h)
    #4 277.188

with &Delta;s

    #1 + 0.004 (u)
    #2 + 0.007
    #3 + 0.008 (h)
    #4 + 0.062

I can't really explain the gain of 62 mg by #4.  However, the others don't seem to have changed much.

For the next cycle, we'll use only #2 and #3 to make mules.  Then we'll do 

* wash
* dry ON
* dry for 15 min on low in the warming oven
* cool for 30 min at RT
