A single user should be Admin, since this is the type of account created during system installation.

Supposedly, if the user unchecks the box in 

System Preferences > Users and Groups?

Then there would be no Admin account and no way to fix things.

I thought this would be impossible, but people have the problem.  Also, some users report that this "happened on its own".

---------------------------------

Launch single-user mode
(restart and hold down Cmd+S)

The screen should say:

Root device is mounted read only

If you want to make modifications to files:
        /sbin/fsck -fy
        /sbin/mount -uw /

The first command is "file system check".

The second command mounts the disk / (that's what we want), as writeable.

Now do:

rm /var/db/.AppleSetupDone
reboot

This resets the Mac to finish the Setup process that normally happens during install, and that includes setting the user's group to Admin.

According to 
https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/79235
/sbin/mount -uw /
should not be necessary.  But this seems to be in error.

---------------------------------

An alternative would be if the root account were activated, or to activate the root account now, and then change the user back to an Admin.

If root is activated, to set up a new user, you do:

dscl . -create /Users/username UserShell /bin/bash
dscl . -create /Users/username RealName "John Smith"
dscl . -create /Users/username UniqueID 1001"
dscl . -create /Users/username PrimaryGroupID 1000"
dscl . -create /Users/username NFSHomeDirectory /Local/Users/username
dscl . -passwd /Users/username password
dscl . -append /Groups/admin GroupMembership username

Only the last would be necessary to make one an Admin.
---------------------------------

You can activate root from the command line 
or in System Preferences > Users and Groups.

However, you can't do any of this if you're not an Admin.

Click Login Options
Authenticate
Click on Network Account Server
Open Directory Utility...
Authenticate (in that window)
Edit
Change Root Password or Enable Root User

---------------------------------

From the command line:

> dsenableroot
username = telliott_admin
user password:
root password:
verify root password:

dsenableroot:: ***Successfully enabled root user.
>

To disable:

> dsenableroot -d
username = telliott_admin
user password:

dsenableroot:: ***Successfully disabled root user.
>

---------------------------------

Following advice on the web:

If necessary, restart in recovery mode:  Cmd+R, Restart.

Then just go to the Utilities menu and choose Terminal.  Enter

resetpassword

Click on the newly opened window and select the volume Macintosh HD.  Now select SystemAdministrator(root) from the dropdown list.  

Type the password twice and click save.

Except there is no longer any selectable volume and no dropdown.

---------------------------------

However, you can do (from Terminal in recovery mode):

dscl . -append /Groups/admin GroupMembership username

(root login is not required).

It is possible to set things so the above doesn't work without a firmware password.

Multiple steps to get root from single user mode here:

/sbin/mount -uw /
launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.opendirectoryd.plist
passwd root

you will be prompted to enter a password twice

reboot
